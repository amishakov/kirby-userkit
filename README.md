## What do you get?
A functional, lean, and unstyled Kirby User Management Add-On (Pre-Release) for Kirby CMS.

**Functionality** | **Comment**
---- | ----
Register / Login| Yes
Logout | Virtual
Change Email | Yep
Change Password | Sure
Export Data | CSV & JSON
Dedicated Role | Of course
CSS | Nope
Success Messages | Not yet. Best is to do it manually to adapt to **YOUR** way of working.

## Why not use login with Google/Facebook/etc.?
Short answer: Privacy! An individual solution like this keeps it simple and create a stronger bond between you and your visitors.

## Why an Add-On?
IMHO a Plug-in does not make sense due to interoperability. 
Also this kind of Add-On adapts way more easy to **YOUR** project.

## Installation:
1. Unzip the files.
1. Paste (overwrite) the folder *content* and *site* on top of the root folder of your Kirby installation.
1. Done!

## Notes:
This Add-On is built for Kirby CMS based on **Kirby´s Starterkit Version 3.5.0**. 

In case you are using Kirby´s Plainkit ensure to add the pages/links for the following pages somewhere in your snippets or templates!

- Register 
- Login
- Logout
- User
